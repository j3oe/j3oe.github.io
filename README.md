# Information

I’m the sole creator of this project—every line of code, every idea, every feature is built independently.  
I strive to write clean, efficient, and thoughtful code while exploring new technologies and pushing my own boundaries.  

If you have suggestions, feedback, or just want to say hi, I’d genuinely appreciate hearing from you. I love connecting with other developers, learning new perspectives, and improving my projects.

# About My Work

I focus on building interactive, efficient, and visually appealing web projects. Some of my favorite areas include:

- Web & UI/UX Development  
- Creative coding and visual effects  
- Tooling and productivity apps  
- Exploring AI, APIs, and back-end integrations  

I aim to make projects that are not only functional but also a joy to interact with, and I enjoy documenting my journey so others can learn or get inspired.
