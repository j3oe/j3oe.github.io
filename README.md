# The Hidden Truth Journal

A parody 2009-style conspiracy blog that rants endlessly about absurd and ridiculous government schemes. This is a fan-made, humorous recreation of chaotic “crazy blog” energy.

## Features
- **Random conspiracy posts** generated on load and on button click.
- **Infinite absurd content**, combining classic conspiracy buzzwords (pigeons, chemtrails, lizard people, fluoride, satellites, etc.).
- **Dark retro blog aesthetic**, typewriter fonts, neon colors, sketchy layout.
- **Button "New Revelation"** instantly generates a new post.
- **No external images** — purely text-based parody.
