    <h1>Hello, my name is Joseph</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my personal blog. This space is where I share the long, reflective journey of my life—
    a story of growing up in Kennewick, learning to pay attention, and discovering passions that now shape who I am.</p>

    <h2>My Experiences</h2>
    <p>While I never had many friends and often felt outside the busy rhythms of childhood, I found
    creativity and focus through coding and painting. These activities became both a refuge and a way
    to connect with the world in my own quiet style.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I am seventeen years old and live for the blend of logic and color found in coding and painting.</li>
      <li>Childhood taught me that attention is not simply a rule to follow but a tool for creating beauty and meaning.</li>
      <li>Trips like my unforgettable visit to Hawaii opened my eyes to the wider world and continue to inspire my art and code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Beginnings in Kennewick</h2>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Kennewick, a city whose quiet streets and wide, pale skies gave me a childhood filled
      more with observation than with conversation. Kennewick never felt loud or hurried; it was a place where
      neighborhoods stretched in modest grids and the Columbia River moved steadily in the background, carrying
      secrets downstream. My earliest memories are of looking out of windows—car windows, bedroom windows,
      classroom windows—and noticing details that adults rarely mentioned: the angle of light on the cracked sidewalk,
      the small shimmer of heat over the asphalt in late summer, the way dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies when the
      afternoon sun found its way through a gap in the curtains. These details were my companions. I did not have
      childhood friends in the way many children do. There were classmates, of course, and the occasional neighbor
      who might wave from a driveway, but connection never rooted itself in those early years. My world was a
      self-contained orbit of thoughts and sensations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because I lacked the constant chatter of friendship, my inner voice became my main source of entertainment. I
      built elaborate stories in my mind about the people I saw while riding in the back seat of my parents’ car. A man
      walking his dog might become a secret inventor. A woman carrying groceries could be a spy disguised in the
      ordinary folds of suburban life. These silent games filled the long stretches of afternoons when other children
      played together in parks or backyards. I did not feel lonely in the way one might expect; instead, I felt wrapped in
      a private layer of imagination that both protected me and separated me from the noisy rhythms of childhood
      friendships. Attention, though, was not my strong suit. Teachers would speak, their voices weaving through
      lessons about numbers or grammar, and I would drift into the slow dance of shadows across the classroom wall.
      I noticed the movement of a single fly near the ceiling with more clarity than the instructions written in bold
      marker on the whiteboard.
    </p>

    <p>
      My parents worried in the quiet way that loving parents do. They attended parent-teacher conferences and heard
      the same polite refrains: “bright but distracted,” “curious but unfocused,” “creative but easily lost in thought.”
      These phrases settled around me like a soft, unspoken expectation—that I was capable of more if only I could
      learn to pay attention. At the time, I could not understand why attention was treated like a currency everyone
      else seemed to spend so easily. To me, the world outside the lesson was more compelling. A single bird outside
      the classroom window could occupy my mind far longer than the neat columns of math problems in front of me.
      What adults called distraction felt, to me, like a deeper kind of noticing. I was not uninterested in the world; I was
      overwhelmed by it.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I grew a little older, small moments began to shift my understanding. Around the age of eleven, I discovered
      the glowing screen of a family computer. It was a hand-me-down machine with keys that stuck and a monitor
      that hummed softly when awakened, but to me it was a doorway. I remember the first time I opened a text editor
      and typed a few lines of HTML, copying them from an online tutorial. The words &lt;html&gt; and
      &lt;body&gt; felt like secret spells. I pressed save, refreshed the browser, and watched as the screen
      obeyed. Something inside me stirred—a recognition that attention could create. Unlike school assignments,
      which seemed to demand obedience for their own sake, coding rewarded focus with visible magic. If I paid
      attention to every bracket and semicolon, a blank page transformed into something alive. It was the first time I
      felt the power of deliberate focus, not as a chore but as a key to building worlds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Painting arrived in my life around the same time, almost as if creativity decided to approach me from two
      different directions—one logical and one visceral. While coding appealed to the orderly part of my mind,
      painting allowed me to embrace chaos. My first set of paints came from a clearance bin at a local store, the
      brushes stiff and the colors slightly dried, but they were treasures nonetheless. I began with messy strokes on
      scrap paper, watching the way colors bled into each other, creating unexpected shapes. Attention here was not
      about precision; it was about presence. To paint, I had to slow down enough to notice the subtle shift of blue into
      green, the way water pooled at the edges of a brushstroke. In these moments, attention became something I gave
      willingly, not something forced upon me by teachers or schedules.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the rare family adventures of my childhood was a trip to Hawaii. I must have been eight years old, though
      the exact age blurs in my memory like the horizon where the sky meets the sea. The journey itself felt mythical:
      the long flight over endless water, the sudden humidity that wrapped around us like a living thing, the unfamiliar
      scent of flowers carried on the ocean breeze. I remember standing barefoot on a stretch of volcanic rock while
      waves crashed and retreated, each one carrying a roar that seemed both frightening and exhilarating. The colors
      of Hawaii remain etched in my mind—the electric greens of palm leaves, the impossible blue of the Pacific, the
      molten red of a sunset spilling across the horizon. It was the first time I felt the world expand beyond the quiet
      borders of Kennewick. Something about that trip whispered that life was wider, deeper, and more intricate than
      the small routines of home.
    </p>

    <p>
      Returning to Kennewick after Hawaii was like waking from a dream. The familiar streets felt smaller, but also
      somehow more significant. I began to notice details I had previously ignored: the grain of wood on our front
      porch, the faint scent of rain on dry pavement, the way the river reflected the changing sky. Attention, once a
      struggle, began to reveal itself as a gift. I still drifted in class, still wandered in thought, but now there was a
      subtle shift. I started to believe that noticing the world—truly noticing—might be a kind of learning all its own.
