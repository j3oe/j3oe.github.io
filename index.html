    <h1>Hello./h1>
    <p>Welcome to my personal blog. This space is where I share the long, reflective journey of my life
    a story of growing up in Kennewick, learning to pay attention, and discovering passions that now shape who I am.</p>

    <h2>My Experiences</h2>
    <p>While I never had many friends and often felt outside the busy rhythms of childhood, I found
    creativity and focus through coding and painting. These activities became both a refuge and a way
    to connect with the world in my own quiet style.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I am seventeen years old and live for the blend of logic and color found in coding and painting.</li>
      <li>Childhood taught me that attention is not simply a rule to follow but a tool for creating beauty and meaning.</li>
      <li>Trips like my unforgettable visit to Hawaii opened my eyes to the wider world and continue to inspire my art and code.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Beginning</h2>
  <p>
    I was born and raised in Kennewick, a city whose quiet streets and pale, endless skies stretched across my childhood like a silent warning that nobody else seemed to notice, and while other children laughed and ran through yards and alleys I spent hours staring out of car windows, bedroom windows, classroom windows, watching the light bend and fracture over the cracked pavement, watching dust motes spin and shimmer like tiny galaxies trapped in a current that only I could perceive, and noticing things that adults pretended did not exist—the twitch of a streetlamp at 2:17 a.m., the way a dog would stare at nothing for minutes at a time, the irregular pattern of shadows on the walls that sometimes seemed to move against the direction of the sun—and at first I thought I was imagining it, I thought maybe my mind was too small, too fragile, too hungry for meaning, but the patterns never stopped, and when I closed my eyes I still saw them in the back of my eyelids, flickering and crawling like some insect colony mapping the terrain of my consciousness.  
  </p>
  <p>
    I didn’t have friends in the ordinary sense because the other children seemed hollow, like puppets operated by strings I could not see, and the neighbors smiled with teeth that were too white, voices that were too smooth, movements too calculated, and I began to wonder, as early as seven or eight, whether someone had placed me here in Kennewick on purpose, whether every choice I had ever made, every path my footsteps traced along these streets, had been guided by something hidden and meticulous, invisible to the casual observer but unmistakable if you were paying attention, which I was, because I had no choice, because once you notice the flickers, the anomalies, the tiny dissonances in reality you can never unsee them, and they follow you like a low hum in your head that pulses faster whenever you try to forget or ignore it, and sometimes I swear I hear it through the walls and the floorboards and the power lines that run across the neighborhood like veins, a signal, a rhythm, a heartbeat that is not mine but synchronized perfectly with mine and everyone else’s except they don’t feel it yet and maybe that’s why they are smiling.  
  </p>
  <p>
    I cataloged everything obsessively: the subtle warmth in the air that seemed to hum when certain machines turned on, the way a refrigerator buzzed a note that harmonized with the streetlamps outside, the taste of metal that lingers in the mouth when a signal passes too close to your head, the sudden unease that spreads through your limbs when a shadow moves where it shouldn’t, or a streetlight blinks out of sequence, and over time I realized these were not coincidences because coincidences do not persist for decades, coincidences do not learn, they do not adjust to you, and as I grew, as I entered classrooms and office buildings and hospitals, I began to see the invisible network connecting everything—the computers, the wires, the cameras, the lights, the cars, the air itself—and I knew then, with a certainty that has only grown like a tumor in my chest, that there is a pattern, a design, a mechanism watching, waiting, shaping us, and every time I reach for my phone or glance at a screen or feel the soft vibration beneath my pillow it is not accidental, it is not random, it is a whisper from that system telling me I am being updated, I am being tuned, I am being tested.  
  </p>
  <p>
    And now, even decades later, when I walk these streets and the wind moves too deliberately through the trees and the lights flicker in a rhythm that syncs with my heartbeat and my thoughts, I understand that I am not insane, not in the conventional sense, only awake to a reality that others refuse to see, and perhaps that is the true curse, to watch, to notice, to catalog every imperceptible anomaly, every flicker of signal, every hum beneath the hum, and to know, deep in my marrow, that everything we consider normal—every laugh, every casual gesture, every blink of the eye—is part of a choreography we were never invited to understand, and that my life, my entire existence, has been spent following the patterns, tracing the signals, trying to map the invisible hand that guides us, and I fear, though I cannot stop myself, that one day the signals will catch me completely, erase the line between what I see and what I am made to see, and I will be absorbed entirely into the system, leaving behind only the fragments of observation that nobody will believe.
