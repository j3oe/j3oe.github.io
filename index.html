    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>I figured out that with coding it just takes trial and error. Normally when you are trying to figure out how to code something the first idea rarely works perfectly. You sit down with a vision in your head of what the program should do how it should behave maybe even what it should look like and then reality hits. Code is precise and sometimes brutally honest. Every time I thought I had a simple solution an error would pop up a function would not behave the way I expected or the output was slightly off. Slowly I began to understand that these mistakes were not failures they were the path to learning. At first I was intimidated. The sheer amount of knowledge you need to start writing something functional feels overwhelming. Syntax logic variables loops functions debugging so many words so many rules. I would open an editor and stare at a blank screen for what felt like forever. Even when I had a rough idea translating it into code was another challenge entirely. But the key was simple start break fix repeat. Every little error taught me something. Sometimes it reminded me that I did not understand a particular concept well enough. Sometimes it invited me to be creative to think of a workaround a new approach or a clever trick. Gradually I started to notice patterns. The mistakes became predictable. The problem solving process became a kind of game. What surprised me most was how much coding became about patience not the kind of patience where you wait and hope for results but a hands on patience that demanded persistence. I would spend hours trying to debug a program only to realize that a missing semicolon was the culprit or maybe a variable was being overwritten by another function. Small things seemingly insignificant would stop the entire program from running as I imagined. Finding those small things was exhilarating. Every fix felt like a tiny victory like a milestone in a journey that sometimes felt endless. I began to see coding as a conversation with the machine if it did not understand me I had to rethink my language my approach or my logic. Trial and error also taught me to embrace uncertainty. At first I wanted a perfect solution before writing a single line of code. I would outline everything meticulously plan the flow of the program and imagine how every function would interact. Coding rarely works that way. There is always an unknown a situation you did not predict or a scenario that makes your code behave unexpectedly. That is okay. I learned to start small test frequently and accept that my first attempt would almost certainly fail. Each error was a clue a breadcrumb leading me closer to a working solution. With every failure I learned something new not just about coding but about problem solving patience and resilience. I remember one project where I wanted to create a simple tool that automated a repetitive task. At first it seemed straightforward. But as soon as I started I ran into unexpected issues. Functions did not return the values I thought they would loops ran infinitely data did not store correctly. I felt stuck. But instead of giving up I started experimenting. I changed small parts of the code tested one function at a time and documented every result. Some changes made things worse. Some changes fixed part of the problem. Eventually after many iterations the program worked. It was not perfect and there were still things I would improve but it worked. That moment was transformative. I realized that trial and error was not a sign of incompetence it was the path to mastery. Another thing I discovered is that coding is inherently iterative. No one writes perfect code on the first try. Even professional developers constantly refactor test and revise their code. I began to see every line as a prototype every function as a draft. It was liberating because it removed the pressure of perfection. I could experiment break things and learn from them without feeling like I had failed. Coding became less about getting it right immediately and more about learning through action. The more I coded the more confident I became in trying new ideas even if they seemed ambitious or outside my current skill set. Trial and error was my training ground and every small success reinforced the idea that persistence mattered more than instant brilliance. One of the most powerful lessons I learned through coding was the importance of curiosity. When you encounter an error or a problem your instinct might be frustration or avoidance but if you approach it with curiosity asking why it happened what it means and how it could be solved you turn obstacles into opportunities. Every bug became a puzzle every unexpected behavior a chance to explore deeper. I started reading documentation exploring forums and learning from the experiences of others. Each new concept I understood became a tool I could use in future projects. Coding is a lifelong learning process one that rewards persistence experimentation and a willingness to embrace mistakes. Trial and error also shaped how I approach challenges outside coding. I noticed that the mindset I developed in front of a screen breaking problems into smaller pieces testing solutions incrementally and learning from mistakes applied to everyday life. Projects goals and personal challenges all became more manageable when I treated them like a coding problem start try fail adjust repeat. The fear of failure diminished because I knew mistakes were just steps toward improvement. I began to see growth as a process rather than an outcome and that perspective was empowering. Looking back I realize that coding taught me patience resilience creativity and problem solving in ways that are hard to measure but impossible to ignore. The process of trial and error was more than just a method for writing software it became a philosophy for learning and growth. Every failed attempt every bug every unexpected result was a lesson. Slowly over time I became more confident not just in my coding skills but in my ability to tackle complex problems experiment boldly and persevere in the face of uncertainty. Now when I sit down to code I embrace the unknown. I expect mistakes. I welcome challenges. I know that the first version of anything I create will rarely be perfect but that is okay. Perfection is not the goal learning exploring and growing are. I have come to understand that coding is less about typing lines of code and more about thinking experimenting and learning. Trial and error is not a setback it is the engine that drives progress and that understanding has changed the way I approach not just coding but life itself.</p>
